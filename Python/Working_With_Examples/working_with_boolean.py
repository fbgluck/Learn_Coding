# Demonstration of Boolean Types
# True and False (Initial Caps) are keyword values
# Don't confuse them with TRUE and FALSE which are constants
# that have to have a value assigned to them.

# Not Equal Operator
var = 0  # Assigning 0 to var
print("var is: ", var, "and is var not equal to 0", var != 0)

var = 1  # Assigning 1 to var
print("var is: ", var, "and is var not equal to 0", var != 0)
print(var != 0)
