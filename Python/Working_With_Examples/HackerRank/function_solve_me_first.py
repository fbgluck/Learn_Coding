# Complete the solveMeFirst function in the editor below.
#
# solveMeFirst function  has the following parameters:
#
# int a: the first value
# int b: the second value
# Returns
# int: the sum of a and b

def solveMeFirst(a,b):
    return(a+b)

# Use the * notation when you are not sure how many arguments are going to be passes.
# The arguments passed are placed in the tuple named after the * 
def solveMeFirst1(*args):
    return args[0] + args[1]

# Keyword Arguments
def solveMeFirst2(firstOp,secondOp):
    return(firstOp + secondOp)
