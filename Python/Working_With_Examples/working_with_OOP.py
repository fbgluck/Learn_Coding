# ### More Details about how to create classes and objects

class DeliveryDroneTypeA: 
   # def in a class is used to create a method
   # the __init__ method (a dunder method) is called as soon as the class is used to instantiate an object. It is often called a "constructor" method.
   # self refers to the class itself. It is always the first parameter when defining a method
   ## Define the method called __init__
  # Note default value for drone_speed
  # This is the constructor. Good practice is to check to see if all the correct parameter were passed.

    # give the object some properties (attributes)
    # These are dynamic attributes. They can be changed
    self.flight_id = flight_id
    self.drone_speed = drone_speed
  #define a property of the object that can not be changed
  fuel_type="JetA" 
  # Define a method called drone_launch
  # ---- End of Constructor --
