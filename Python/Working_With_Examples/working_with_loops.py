# Sample code for Loops
######################################################
# For loops typically use the range(start, stop, interval) function
# The stop value is required. 
#   If one arg is supplied, it is assumed to be stop
# Start default = 0
# Interval default = 1
# Testing of the value is done before the loop statements are executed
# If the test fails, executions continues at the first statement outside the loop

# The range function with defaults
print("Count from 0 to 4 (5 items) using the range() function")
# by default, the starting is 0, the ending is 5
for value in range(5): 
    print(f"The value is now {value}")
#This increases the variable by 2 (start,step,interval)
for value in range(1,100,2): 
    print (f"The number is {value}")
